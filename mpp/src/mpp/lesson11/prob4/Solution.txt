a)
List<Integer> ints = new ArrayList<>();
ints.add(1);
ints.add(2);
List<? extends Number> nums = ints;
double dbl = sum(nums);
nums.add(3.14)

*Answer: There will be a compile error on 6th line "nums.add(3.14"
Since we can assign ints to nums, but the generic of nums is
the "? extends" wildcard, so we can not add new element to it (line 6th)
 

b)
List<Object> objs = new ArrayList<>();
objs.add(1);
objs.add("two");
List<? super Integer> ints = objs;
ints.add(3);
double dbl = sum(ints);

*Answer:
There will be a compile on the 6th line "double dbl = sum(ints);"
since the ints list is "? super Integer", we can add new elements to it,
but the sum method take the "? extends Number" wildcard as parameter.
